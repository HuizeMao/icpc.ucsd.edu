The Competitive Programming Club at UCSD is an undergraduate student organization.
The current leadership is:

We are looking for more principal members, especially Freshmen and Sophomores.

The official team email is [icpc@ucsd.edu](mailto:icpc@ucsd.edu), though you can
also copy leadership members. Our main form of communication is our

to connect with us and discuss interesting problems.

## Past Competitions
In 2019, we sent four teams to the SoCal ICPC Regional, and our best team placed
third. That team went on to participate in the North American Championship.
